# Water-Simulation with Realtime Reflections/Refractions from the Surface
This project consists of several smaller projects joined together. Pretty much everything is done completely from
scratch. So no external libraries or dependencies (except basic OpenGL) are needed to run this simulation.

The final endresult looks like that:

## **Water-Simulation**


## **Install && Run**

I only tested an ran this simulation on a debian-based unix OS (Ubuntu, Mint, ...). It should run on any other machine as well but is not
tested.

### **Requirements**

The following system-attributes are required for running this simulation:

- A graphics card supporting OpenGL version 3.3 (For the shaders).

- Unix-Libraries: xorg-dev, freeglut3-dev and mesa-common-dev

### **Running**

Compiling and running is pretty straight forward.

- ./compile.sh

- ./particles

While the simulation runs, you can move around (always looking to the center!) with your mouse (left-klick and move) and zoom in/out with your mouse (right click and move up/down).
